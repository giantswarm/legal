# Quotas and Limits

In general, you are limited only by the amount of resources you can book within the system. What is inside of your cluster is your business.

However, we suggest you contact us before going over the following limits:

* 5 nodes per cluster
* 32GB RAM per node
* 50 pods per node
* persistent storage volume over 100GB per volume

We will adapt these soft limits as time goes on.

Please [contact us](/contact/) if you have any questions regarding this.
