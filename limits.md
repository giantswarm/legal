# Quotas and Limits

In general, you are limited only by the amount of resources you can book within the system. 

However, we enforce these restrictions:

* IN CASE OF NON PAYMENT WE KILL EVERYTHING
* a maximum of XX containers per kubelet ???
* a memory (RAM) of maximum 16 GB per kubelet ???
* a storage size limit of 100 GB per volume
* a log retention time limit of 14 days

Please [contact us](/contact/) if you have any questions regarding this.
