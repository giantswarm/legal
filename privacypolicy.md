- If the processing of your personal data is considered unlawful, but you do not require the deletion of your personal data.
- If we no longer need the data for the purposes of its processing, but you need it for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
- If you object to our processing of your data based on our legitimate interests under Art. 6(1) (f) GDPR, or where the processing is based on Art. 6(1) (e) GDPR.
